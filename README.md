<h2>The platform can be used by the people to store all their digital assets.
Users will have their profiles which can be shared with anyone, with the
user’s consent (or by providing a valid death certificate).
  
This profile will have all the information regarding the user, including
important documents, identity cards, etc. So, instead of managing
individual certificates and cards, the user will only have to manage a
single account which can be used for all the legal documentation.
  
Once there is a request to access a specific document, from any user’s
profile, he/she will receive an OTP (along with the requesting user’s
details) to grant access to the requesting user. This will ensure that there
is no unauthorised access to the user’s personal documents.
  
At a user's unfortunate demise, his/her relative will have to produce the
death certificate. After the verification of legitimacy of the death
certificate , the relative will gain access to his locker. This said relative’s
information will be provided by the user at the time of registration.</h2>
